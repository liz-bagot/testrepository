 # Decred Educational Resources Repository: Schema

Decred’s target audiences need to be better educated about Decred. Education will crystalize who Decred is, attract a wider audience, and prepare it for the next bull market. There’s a lot of good educational content in various places, but it can be difficult for journalists, crypto enthusiasts, investors, etc. to find it. While https://docs.decred.org/ is a good resource for people who already know Decred, it’s not intuitive for beginners and doesn’t pool together external resources. 

We need an easy-to-find, external-facing Decred Resources Repository that helps non-Decred people get acquainted with the project by curating the very best content on each subject. Here's a sample schema we can model: https://www.lopp.net/bitcoin-information.html

Below, each macro topic is denoted by a number. When visitors click on it, it will lead to another webpage with sub-topics, underneath which are hyperlinks to content. E.g. If the macro topic is "Governance: Hybrid PoW/Pos", you click and it leads you to sub-topics like "Primer on Consensus Mechanisms", "How Hybrid PoW/PoS Works", etc. 

Please add what you consider to the the BEST links to online resources that correspond to the topics below, using the standard [text formatting to add hyperlniks] (https://help.github.com/en/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#links). E.g., any links about Decred's history should go under "History of Decred: Foundational Documents", while links about how Decred's consensus mechanism works go under "How Hybrid PoW/PoS" works. Let's limit ourselves to only the best resources — we don't want an exhaustive list, but a highly curated list.

(*When readers click on "Mission & Vision," they will be taken to another webpage containing the text below*)

Decred is a community-directed digital currency with built-in governance to make it a superior long-term store of value. Decred is designed to deliver a truly decentralized, fair, and sovereign alternative to traditional money. In the current system, a centralized authority such as a bank or government holds the power. With Decred, the community members own and operate the system, make the rules, and determine the direction of the project. The result is a secure and adaptable currency that is a superior store of value. Everyone is invested and actively involved in helping Decred succeed.  

Mission: Decred aims to become the world’s first truly decentralized autonomous organization. It is achieving this aim by building a self-directed digital currency whose security, adaptability, and sustainability make it a superior long-term store of value. 

Vision: Decred’s vision is to build a self-directed, decentralized future ruled by the collective intelligence of the community. It will be built upon the pillars of sovereignty, fairness, transparency, inclusivity, privacy, and security. Everyone can vote on the rules and project-level decision making proportionately to their stake, yielding decisions and policies in the best interest of all — not just a select few.
