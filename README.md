 # Decred Educational Resources Repository: Schema
 
Decred’s target audiences need to be better educated about Decred. Education will crystalize who Decred is, attract a wider audience, and prepare it for the next bull market. There’s a lot of good educational content in various places, but it can be difficult for journalists, crypto enthusiasts, investors, etc. to find it. While https://docs.decred.org/ is a good resource for people who already know Decred, it’s not intuitive for beginners and doesn’t pool together external resources. 

We need an easy-to-find, external-facing Decred Resources Repository that helps non-Decred people get acquainted with the project by curating the very best content on each subject. Here's a sample schema we can model: https://www.lopp.net/bitcoin-information.html

Below, each macro topic is denoted by a number. When visitors click on it, it will lead to another webpage with sub-topics, underneath which are hyperlinks to content. E.g. If the macro topic is "Governance: Hybrid PoW/Pos", you click and it leads you to sub-topics like "Primer on Consensus Mechanisms", "How Hybrid PoW/PoS Works", etc. 

Please add what you consider to the the BEST links to online resources that correspond to the topics below, using the standard [text formatting to add hyperlniks] (https://help.github.com/en/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#links). E.g., any links about Decred's history should go under "History of Decred: Foundational Documents", while links about how Decred's consensus mechanism works go under "How Hybrid PoW/PoS" works. Let's limit ourselves to only the best resources — we don't want an exhaustive list, but a highly curated list.
